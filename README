NAME
    CPAN::Changes - Read and write Changes files

SYNOPSIS
        # Load from file
        my $changes = CPAN::Changes->load( 'Changes' );

        # Create a new Changes file
        $changes = CPAN::Changes->new(
            preamble => 'Revision history for perl module Foo::Bar'
        );
    
        $changes->add_release( {
            version => '0.01',
            date    => '2009-07-06',
        } );

        $changes->serialize;

DESCRIPTION
    It is standard practice to include a Changes file in your distribution.
    The purpose the Changes file is to help a user figure out what has
    changed since the last release.

    People have devised many ways to write the Changes file. A preliminary
    specification has been created (CPAN::Changes::Spec) to encourage module
    authors to write clear and concise Changes.

    This module will help users programmatically read and write Changes
    files that conform to the specification.

METHODS
  new( %args )
    Creates a new object using %args as the initial data.

  load( $filename )
    Parses $filename as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.

  load_string( $string )
    Parses $string as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.

  preamble( [ $preamble ] )
    Gets/sets the preamble section.

  releases( [ @releases ] )
    Without any arguments, a list of current release objects is returned
    sorted by ascending release date. When arguments are specified, all
    existing releases are removed and replaced with the supplied
    information. Each release may be either a regular hashref, or a
    CPAN::Changes::Release object.

        # Hashref argument
        $changes->releases( { version => '0.01', date => '2009-07-06' } );
    
        # Release object argument
        my $rel = CPAN::Changes::Release->new(
            version => '0.01', date => '2009-07-06
        );
        $changes->releases( $rel );

  add_release( @releases )
    Adds the release to the changes file. If a release at the same version
    exists, it will be overwritten with the supplied data.

  delete_release( @versions )
    Deletes all of the releases specified by the versions supplied to the
    method.

  release( $version )
    Returns the release object for the specified version. Should there be no
    matching release object, undef is returned.

  serialize( )
    Returns all of the data as a string, suitable for saving as a Changes
    file.
